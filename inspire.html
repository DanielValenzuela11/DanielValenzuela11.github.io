        		One person who inspires me almost everyday is James Hetfield. As the rhythm guitarist and vocalist for <strong>Metallica</strong>, I know he has left an impact on a countless number of people in many different ways.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		Some of James' qualties that inspire me in everyday life include:
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Songwriting and musical ability</li>
        		<li>Down-to-earthness</li>
			<li>Integrity and resilience</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Everyday James and his music inspires me to pick up my guitar and play along to Metallica's songs or create my own songs. His songwriting is masterful not only with his powerful lyrics, but there are many instances where you can feel the raw emotions that were going through him while he was recording his guitar tracks. Furthermore James has suffered through a lot of adversy during his life and his willingess to be open and truthful with everybody and push through those difficult times is something that really speaks to me and shows just how strong of a person he is, regardless of the fact that he has had to go to rehab multiple times, nothing truly stops him from doing what he loves. Without Mr. Hetfield, my life and career goals would be much different than they are now as my dream of becoming a guitar luthier is in no small part thanks to him.
