        <h2>Funny Basketball Moments</h2>
        <p>My favorite sport is basketball and as is the case for almost every true basketball fan, they will know of the hilariousness that is Charles Barkley as a TV Analyst. This is just one of my favorite clips, however there are countless of other priceless moments that "Sir Charles" has had throughout his career. </p>

        <h2>Fake Basketball Quotes</h2>
        <p>Continuing on with the basketball theme, another great source of basketball related laughter can be found on a twitter page, with the sole purpose of creating fake quotes said by players. Most people who come across the posts will probably know that they are fake based on the context, however, as the posts get shared and retweeted, it becomes harder for people to realize that the posts are not real, mainly due to not recognizing the original source of the posts. Eventually, this leads to reputable sources and major sports news outlets talking about the false quotes on their shows, under the impression that the quotes are actually legitimate. Although the dead giveaway that the quote is not real is from looking at the actual name of the twitter profile, which I will leave for you to see.  </p>

        <h2>Memes</h3>
        <p>Who doesn't love memes? Nowadays, you can't scroll though social media or even websites without coming across a meme and I do enjoy myself some good memes. It was a bit hard to pinpoint an exact place for memes as the majority of where I see my memes is on Instagram, and many of those profiles are private. Therefore, the official subreddit for memes is the next best place and you can defintely find some great memes on there.
